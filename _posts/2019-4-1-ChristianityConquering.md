Much of the language of the Bible regarding the coming of the Godking Jesus Christ is ambiguous at best and confusing at worst. By design, many of the prophesies within its pages were fulfilled in ways that neither the devout or the gentile would ever anticipate and this certainly holds true for Christ’s concerning statement of “Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.”<sup>[1]</sup> (Matthew 10:34) While Christ never led a military campaign against the sovereign Roman government, the cultural of the early Christians managed to conquer the hearts and minds of the Romans in a much more subtle way.

An investigation into this topic bears to mention the state of affairs of the Romans around the time of Christ’s ministry (roughly 30AD) -- especially with regards to religion. In their prime, the Romans boasted one of the most expansive and diverse empires in antiquity and did so in large part through their tolerance for many cultures. As long as allegiance could be sworn to Caesar, the Roman people saw little problem with their outer territories preserving their respective heritage, cultures and religions. And so, one by one, diverse gods such as Isis from the Egyptians and Mithras from the Persians were eventually assimilated into the polytheistic Pantheon of Roman Gods.<sup>[2]</sup> 

This technique came to a head though as the borders of eclipsed the Middle East where it brushed up against monotheistic religions such as Judaism and soon to come Christianity. Jews, just like Christians, refused to bow down to the various array of Roman Gods although their culture and traditions was inherently inwardly focused and more about preserving a heritage than evangelizing a gospel. Judaism’s established history earned it a respect and reverence that could not be said for the newly founded Christianity that was built up by those on the margins of society from its origin.<sup>[3]</sup> It was this radical new interpretation of monotheism that led Jesus Christ himself to be martyred at hand of the state and the religious elite of the time. As history clearly shows though the death of Christ was, if anything, the start of Christianity’s spread, not its end.

As Christ’s disciples began to preach his message throughout the Mediterranean tensions simmered in Rome until they quickly reach a boiling point in 64AD. In that year Rome suffered the worst fire in its history reducing nearly 3/4th of the city to rubble and the ignominious Nero found a convenient scapegoat in the Christians.<sup>[4]</sup> Nero staged a targeted attack on Christians killing and torturing them in the most demeaning ways but this only added all the more zeal to the early sects. From that time forward the Christians continued to face vile by mostly sporadic and infrequent bouts of persecution. When inquired about the newly emerging sect, Emperor Trajan wrote a letter indicating that the Christians “were not to be hunted or sought out”.<sup>[5]</sup> For nearly three centuries a cycle of growth and persecution, martyrdom and conversion continued throughout the Roman empire until one event dramatically shifted the power dynamic of the empire.

In 310AD Rome was in the midst of a brutal civil war. Constantine, one of the leaders of the divided Roman factions, found himself facing a formidable force twice his size in the now famous battle of Milvian Bridge. The night before the conflict Constantine allegedly had a vision where he was instructed to mark their shields with an unfamiliar symbol now emblematic of Christ throughout Italy.<sup>[6]</sup> Constantine and his men emerged victorious in this pivotal battle soon leaving Constantine as defacto emperor of all of Rome. In honor of this new emperor, the Arch of Constantine was erected to commemorate his victory at Milvian Bridge— whereon is read the inscription “inspired by the divine”.<sup>[7]</sup> While this may be interpreted as a clear embrace of Christianity Constantine himself never fully converted until he was at his deathbed. His tolerance towards the religion was likely influenced by the horrible persecution the Christians faced under Diocletian, one of his enemies in the previous civil war. Constantine later formalized his tolerance of the religion in the Edict of Milan.<sup>[8]</sup> Under his rule we see the Romans not only pivot to accept the Christians but begin to leverage their organized nature, integrating the Christian’s structure of power and clergy with Rome’s own.

As Christianity grew into fledging congregations the office of bishop was established to oversee administrative needs in their respective cities in villages. These began as equal members of a council but after some time natural hierarchies emerged.<sup>[9]</sup> By the time of Constantine, the bishop of Rome (now regarded as Pope Sylvester I) was seen as the defacto leader of the Christians and with this title commanded a unique position of power and influence that in many regards overreached those of any state figure. All the more, influence over Christians at large would provide the Romans with soft power that could extend far past their political borders. 

Shrewdly aware of these political advantages, Constantine made many strides form strategic partnerships with the church offering many donations and concessions to the newly instated Roman clergy.<sup>[10]</sup> In the San Silvestro Chapel, a fresco depicts the merging of the power between church and state wherein Constantine, sitting on his throne, bestows Saint Sylvester with a crown symbolized a shared level of power and prestige.<sup>[11]</sup> While many doctrinal debates would continue within the Christian sects throughout the ensuing centuries, Constantine’s actions put into motion the legitimization of a Papal rule and an enduring synergetic relationship between the Roman government and Roman Catholicism.

Over those ensuing centuries countless monuments and chapels were erected to honor Christ and the new patron saints. As many critics of Roman Catholicism argue, the adoption and veneration of saints could be seen as Roman traditions contaminating the pure messages of Christ as recorded in the gospels. This applies all the more to assimilation of Christianity’s biggest holiday, Christmas, with the pagan festivals of the Winter Solstice.<sup>[12]</sup> Yet conversely a modern-day visitor of Rome, with St. Peter’s Basilica and the entire city-state of the Vatican at the heart of the supposed ‘eternal city’, can see a tale of Christianity clearly conquering Rome. As the scholar Dr. Schuler noted “Christians literally built churches over the ruins of the roman temples which physically signified the change in religious affiliation”.<sup>[13]</sup> A salient example of this can be found in the Curia Julia. It was originally meant to be a senate house to where the Roman government would congregate to debate. When it was left unfinished at Julius Caesar’s untimely death, Augustus his successor finished the project to commemorate the fallen ruler adorning it with two large imposing bronze doors. Today those very doors that opened up to the Roman senate have been retrofitted in the relatively obscure St. John Lateran Cathedral.<sup>[14]</sup> 

In this sense, where Christian architecture and art literally replaced that honoring previous emperors and pagan gods, the conquer of Christianity could not have been more Roman—the Romans themselves built an empire off of crassly trampling whatever elements of their foes’ culture and society would be incongruent with the empire and assimilating what was. While we could debate ad nauseum on how absolute the conquering of Christianity was on previous cultures of the Mediterranean, we could certainly say it done in true Roman style.
