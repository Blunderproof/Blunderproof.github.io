When I made the decision to make a blog one thing stood out to me. I wanted to help establish a personal brand, a logo even. So after some thought and tinkering I came up with this. 

<p>
<img src="/img/logo/abovemu_white.png" alt="Personal Logooo" style="
    width:20%; min-width: 300px; 
    display: block;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;"/>

A greater than sign followed by the Greek symbol mu. Mu, or μ, has a number of uses across the sciences although if you have some background in stats you might get the low-brow joke I'm going for. In statistics μ is used to designate the 'grand mean' effect in a model. If we can attribute some phenomonon to given explanation X, Y, or Z, μ serves as the effective baseline that those effects are built on top of. 

While in traditional additive statistical models it is never used with logical operators such as > or < but the cheeky gist of the message is 'Above Average' in a succinct little symbol. I have been fascinated with the use of symbols in modern society. How something as simple as the Nike swoosh can become so ubiquitous with athleticism, how McDonald's Golden Arches can become a more recognized figure than Jesus Christ. Sometime soon I want to explore a dataset related to that and, well a lot of things.

I have in plan for this site a weekly or maybe bi-monthly data exploration of some topic I individually find fascinating. We'll see where we start off though.
