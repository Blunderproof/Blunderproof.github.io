Suicide in antiquity, just as today, remains a complex issue. Greek society and schools of thought seldom consider it as an epidemic or systematic problem of society although its legends and deeply personal accounts speak volumes regarding the complex individual issues that can lead one to that last resort. By studying these accounts and comparing them with the circumstances of our day we can learn much about the intimate and profoundly human conditions that drive individuals to suicide.

A crucial element to consider in discussing suicide in ancient Greek society is the lens through which their history and culture was preserved. The advent of precise and well-documented reports of history was a rather recent one – many of the great story of life and death in antiquity were passed down orally and often with an eye more for passing on entertainment and moral narratives than necessarily accurate ones. While not always strictly accurate to our modern perspectives, the public generally took the grandiose mythological stories of the time at face value, especially as they relate to questions of morality.<sup>[1]</sup> 

With acknowledging this necessary context, one of the first observations that stands out is the near ever-present belief of life consisting of mortals facing unsurmountable and superhuman obstacles. Throughout Greek myth and lore humans were subject to the idle passions of gods and destined to rise and fall by prophetic rites. We see an example of this in the book 22 of the Iliad where Hector, moments away from his death proclaims “I hear the gods calling me to my death… Zeus and Apollo must have chosen this long ago”.<sup>[2]</sup> With regards to questions of life and death philosopher Socrates wrote “a man, who is one of the god’s possessions, should not kill himself until the god sends some compulsion upon him, as he sends compulsion on us at present” <sup>[3]</sup>. Socrates himself, upon being condemned to death by an array of political figures newly risen to power, famously commits suicide by drinking a cup of poisonous hemlock as a statement of control in sight of his inevitable demise. Plato records the trial and defense of this account in Apology of Socrates. <sup>[4]</sup> For Socrates, such behavior was an entirely natural and appropriate reaction to the circumstance at hand. If people were to play ‘with the cards they were dealt’, the dealers of destiny pervading Greek poem and myth would be the Fates or Moirai as they were known to the Greeks.

Often personified as 3 decrepit old sisters, Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos spun and wove threads of sheer human destiny. Clotho would spin the threads, Lachesis dispensing and prolonging it with Atropos, the inflexible, finally cutting it-- in so doing determining the individual’s moment of death. In the Iliad we see a clear example of the credence members of Greek society weigh on the Fates. In Book 19 Agamemnon disregards all responsibility for his own arrogance stating “Howbeit it is not I that am at fault, but Zeus and Fate (Moira)…. they cast upon my soul fierce blindness on that day, when of mine own arrogance I took from Achilles his prize.”<sup>[5]</sup> The power of the Moirai cannot be understated with one Greek poet going as far to say “To the Moirai the might of Zeus must bow;”<sup>[6]</sup>. We see this respect for the Moirai with our next figure Pythagoras.

Pythagoras, like many great men of Greek antiquity, has his life passed down to us in as much legend as hard facts. One of the many aspects of his life where the lines between fiction and reality blur are the tales of his death. In some accounts he and his devotees were trapped in a burning house surrounded by enemies only escaping by his disciples voluntarily laying themselves over the flames to build a human bridge for Pythagoras. With their sacrifice, he managed to escaped but was left so despondent at the death of his beloved students that he committed suicide. Other accounts have him fleeing from his enemies until he was confronted with a large field of beans that, under his strict principles of asceticism, were sacred and could not be crossed. He stopped in his tracks and let himself be captured and killed.<sup>[7]</sup> While we will likely never know the exact details of his death those stories that circulate regarding his life and supposed suicide teach us a lot about the close relationship between honor and suicide had in Greek culture.

This cultural study naturally brings us to cross-examine our own culture and what factors lead those in modern society to contemplate suicide. With little regard or exception to circumstance, the predominant religions around the world in our day stand obstinately against suicide. Additionally, in both theistic and agnostic schools of thought there has been a pivotal shift towards the ‘ennoblement of man’ compared to antiquity. From the manuscripts of John Locke to the Katy Perry’s pop hit “Roar” messages of individual empowerment and free-will have permeated all levels of culture; to a state in which man is not merely the idle plaything of Gods and Goddesses. Even if we no longer fatalistically view ourselves subject to the whims of the Fates and Gods there is an ever-rising awareness to the barrage of indifferent socio-psychological afflictions many around us suffer.

This acknowledge socio-psychological afflictions is especially evident in light of the fact that today one of six Americans are prescribed with some type of psychiatric drug, the most prominent of which being antidepressants.<sup>[8]</sup> In a United States study, over 90 percent of suicides were found to be associated with mental illness including alcohol and/or substance abuse.<sup>[9]</sup> The Greeks, given they had Bacchus, a God dedicated for wine and lavish festivals, didn’t explicitly condemn alcoholism or gluttony but do in some instances acknowledge the impact of substance abuse. In book 9 of the Odyssey Homer presents us we a group of ‘Lotus-Eaters’ of which Odysseus accounts “Whoever ate that sweet fruit lost the will to report back, preferring instead to stay there, munching lotus, oblivious of home.”<sup>[10]</sup> While the substance abuse may be a resonant point between modern Western society and ancient Greek in other parts of the world though there is research to suggest that topics of honor and pride still reign among the most serious factors influencing suicide. A cross-cultural study identified economic hardship, family disputes and public humiliation to be the most significant factors influencing suicide in India. (While confirming the results of the previously mentioned studies for the Americas.)<sup>[11]</sup> These triggers provide an intimate and vexing perspective on the values of their respective cultures and gives footing to arguments that modern society, despite its cultural and technological leaps over antiquity, has not helped its most vulnerable overcome the base hedonistic instincts - that it has not effectively taught human virtues such as compassion and humility.

Needless to say, in both ancient modern society the reasons that lead people to suicide don’t fit nicely into a box. Amidst a world with such a diversity of external and internal factors leading people silently to contemplate suicide it may appear that suicide prevention is a hopeless cause yet through almost all studies there is an acknowledgement to the impact family, friends and counselors can have on those individuals lives. 

Regardless of time, location, or culture, social isolation remains one of the most salient features that leads people to contemplate suicide. Afterall, Odysseus reuniting with his family is the central point of the drama throughout all of the Odyssey. The silver lining to look towards in this is the simple fact that we ourselves have to power to help others feel belonging and real connection; to remind them that their problems are not unique, and that we only need to take a brief look back on history and literature to find common bonds that have much to teach us.
