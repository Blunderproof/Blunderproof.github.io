## Epithets

For the unacquainted, epithets served in ancient Greece as a literary device to present characters by appending a succinct little phrase to their name.
Think along the lines of Alexander the Great, Bright-Eyed Athena or Samwise the Brave.

In this spirit I've developed a few to present myself.

#### Incessant Tinkerer

From a young age I couldn't keep my hands off of anything that I could tweak, customize or, more often than I would have liked to admit, break. At age 13 I hacked together a speaker for my iPod Nano from the remains of an old desktop speaker, a trendy tin watch case and a battery pack. My wallet until just recently was one of many previous renditions of a meticulously duct-taped pattern. The cold acumulation of objects that envolve us in this consumerism age can transcend their mass-produced nature and become truly cherished belongings as we dedicate real time and energy into making them our own. In recent years though programming has more than satisfied that itch I have to tinker.


#### International-Backpacker

Almost always accompanied by my amazing wife, I've been able to live the college dream of traveling the world with nothing more than the clothes on our back. Be it strolling the beaches of Portugal, biking through Amsterdam -- the Grand Canyon or Pike's Place Market we've started a lifelong journey to explore the world. We've slept on a lot of overnight buses and overpacked hostels, been welcomed in the home of strangers and welcomed them into ours on occasion. Simplifying and reducing your life's posessions to the point it can fit on your shoulders for weeks at a time is one of the most liberating experience this world has to offer. 

#### Musical Explorer

I'm more often than not found with two earbuds snuggly fit into my ears. My preferred genres fall into various flavors of Indie-Rock, Jazz, Chillhop, Folk, R&B, Baroque Pop and a dozen other pretensious sounding labels I could toss out. Most of my listening is split between Spanish and English with other languages occasionally mixed in. Some hot recommendations I'd pass along: The Marias, Tycho, The Postal Service, The XX, Mt. Joy, Los Espiritus, Vetusta Morla, Leon Bridges, Vicente Garcia, Carlos Sadness, Tame Impala, The War on Drugs, Sylvan Esso, Natalia Lafourcade, Residente, Julien Dore, Coeur de Pirate, Junius Meyvant.

#### Conscious Global Citizen

I unabashedly declare that I love life and the world and the makes it possible. In this age I see more need for walls and barriers to be taken down than for new ones to be built up. I vote, I recycle where possible, I participate with the local refugee community in Salt Lake City. I was an eagle scout and try my best to live to the slogan of doing a good turn daily. Over my two years of missionary service with the delightful people of Paraguay I learned a lot more about what is essential in this life. In additional to my belief in a restored gospel of Jesus Christ, all of these aspects help me feel like a more whole and complete man.
